      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This novel is about a dog, Buck, who was sold by his owner to the sled dog industry in Canada. Buck learns how to survive in the harsh climate and the competitive sled dog environment. He does this all with changing owners and feeling an intense connection to the nature around him.</p>
      <p><strong>Review:</strong> This is a must-read book and a novel rightfully considered a classic of modern literature. London beautifully balances the importance of communication and incredible descriptions of setting and inner thoughts. The singularity in this book aims to question what is our nature. With analogies through the life a dog, London demands readers to consider the violence, and the meaning of humanity.</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The film takes place in the stalemate of trench warfare that continued for years. The film portrays soldiers forced to take on an impossible mission for the sake of a promotion for a self-serving General Paul Mireau. The mission fails, tons of soldiers die, troops fail to advance, and so three randomly chosen soldiers are court-martialed for acts of cowardice. The men are unfairly found guilty and executed the next day. During the events, Colonel Dax, initially refuses the suicidal mission and then, represents his soldiers in their court-martial. This movie addresses the reaction of authorities against soldiers that committed alleged treason through cowardice, disobeying orders and retreating from overly fatal situations.</p>
      <p><strong>Review:</strong> This film is an incredibly film because it really changes the trajectory of war movies. Stanley Kubrick ask the cost of human life and makes us consider the horrors of the war and the struggle within the military chain of command</p>
